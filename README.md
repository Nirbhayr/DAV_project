# APTOS Blindness Dataset. Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Fundus Images

This work was also submitted for DS 294 (CDS course at IISc) final project for year 2020-2021

The project is based on deep learning using the dataset from kaggle from the APTOS blindness challenege. The dataset can be viewed here, https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/overview

The project was based on `transfer learning` approach and pre-trained ResNet50 (trained on ImageNet) was used for this task.
